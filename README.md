## Current Issues
1. Scraping might not get all necessary data due to Amazon CAPTCHA
2. **No testing**
3. No optimization of assets (uglify, concatenation, etc.)
4. I'm quite doubtful on MongoDB, maybe should have used Postgres
5. Data stored in database is not normalized
6. No authentication or security implemented, which lead to issue 7 below
7. Only **R** in **CRUD** for DB API is implemented
